<p>Mathematics is the language of science and logic the language of argument. Science students are often surprised, and sometimes daunted, by the prevalence of mathematical ideas and techniques which form the basis for scientific theory. The more abstract ideas of pure mathematics may find fewer everyday applications, but their study instils an appreciation of the need for rigorous, careful argument and an awareness of the limitations of an argument or technique. A mathematics degree teaches the skills to see clearly to the heart of difficult technical problems, and provides a “toolbox” of ideas and methods to tackle them.</p>

<p>The Mathematics degrees can lead to either a BA after three years or an MMath after four years, though you will not be asked to choose between these until your third year. Both courses are highly regarded: the employability of graduates of both degrees is extremely high, and BA graduates can still go on to second degrees, Masters or PhDs. The four-year course has been accredited by the Institute of Mathematics and its Applications as meeting the educational requirements for the Chartered Mathematician (CMath) designation, and the three-year course has similarly been accredited to meet the educational requirements when followed by subsequent training and experience in employment equivalent to a taught Masters degree.</p>

<p>The first year consists of compulsory courses that all mathematics students take. A list of current courses is given in the table below. Computational Mathematics involves practical computing classes using MATLAB – a popular piece of mathematical software. The course involves introductory sessions in the first term, and two projects in the second term, which count towards the grade for the year. Otherwise, the year is assessed through end-of-year exams, with students taking five papers, each 2-3 hours in duration.</p>

<p>In the second year students have some choice over the content that they study. There are currently three compulsory courses in the first term that are each contain prerequisite knowledge for many of the later courses, and then second-year students take five or six long options and three short options.</p>

<p>In the third year still more options become available, giving students the opportunity to specialise, or to take courses in a variety of topics. There are currently courses on a wide range of topics in pure mathematics and applied mathematics, and options such as the philosophy or the history of mathematics, an extended essay, or a structured project. A current list of courses is shown in the table below. Students choose eight units (some "double unit" courses count as two units), with written exams at the end of the year, some of which may be replaced by practicals or projects, depending on the options chosen. At most four of those units can come from the Statistics, Computer Science, or from the Other options, with at most two units from any one of those categories. If you're interested in taking more Statistics options than that, then you might be interested in the joint honours Mathematics and Statistics degree course, which offers students the option to take more than 25% of their third-year courses in Statistics.</p>

<p>Currently an upper second over second and third year, as well as an upper second in third year alone, is required to progress to fourth year. The fourth year has even more options (too many to list below!) with a current list at<link/> https://courses.maths.ox.ac.uk.</link></p>
